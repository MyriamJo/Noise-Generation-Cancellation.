# Noise Generation Cancellation

## Programming Language
Python

## Description
This project focuses on generating and canceling noise to preserve the integrity of a musical piece. The task involves creating a rendition of the song "Do-Re-Mi" from The Sound of Music ("Do, a deer, a female deer") within a span of 3 seconds. Using frequencies from the 3rd and 4th octaves of a piano, we manage the duration of each key note to accurately reproduce the song.

During playback, additional noise is introduced by pressing two random piano keys simultaneously. The primary objective is to develop a method to cancel out the noise by working in the frequency domain, separating each frequency and ensuring the original song can be clearly extracted.
